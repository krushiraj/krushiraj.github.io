github/krushiraj/react-native-tips

This is a repository where I keep on adding new tips and suggestions to work on [`React Native`](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/). Few of them were taken from several sources on the web when I was surfing to solve few problems I faced. Few are my personal recommendations and suggestions that I felt would be helpful for everyone.

If you have any suggestions or tips that are not added in the repository yet. Please feel free to raise a PR with all the tips and suggestions from your side. Thank you. ðŸ˜€
