There is the `fetch` API in Node, which allows us to make a HTTP request and get some information from the servers. We can use that to make REST calls, get HTML content of a webpage(if we are using node for scraping) and many more things.

> This article is valid for any function that returns a promise.

An example of such call goes like this

```js
fetch("/url")
  .then(res => res.json())
  .then(data => console.log(data))
```

## The Async way

We could do the same thing, using async and await.

```js
const result = await fetch("/url")
const data = await result.json()

console.log(data)

// Or, a one-liner
// const data = await (await fetch('/url')).json(); ðŸ˜‰
```
