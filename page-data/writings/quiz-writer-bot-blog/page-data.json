Prior to this I worked on some proprietary frontend framework by ServiceNow, which was made by picking best of both worlds from React and Vue.

Everything was built as generic as possible to extend the capabilities and functionalities with ease. Auto complete suggestions feature was implemented based on the meta data that I had in an object.
