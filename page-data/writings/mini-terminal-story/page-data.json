The executor will identify the command and execute the function that maps to command. In this way we can have any number of commands and functionalities added with ease in future. Everything was built as generic as possible to extend the capabilities and functionalities with ease. Auto complete suggestions feature was implemented based on the meta data that I had in an object. This is where I have mappings to command names, functions, help text and meta related to arguments and options.
