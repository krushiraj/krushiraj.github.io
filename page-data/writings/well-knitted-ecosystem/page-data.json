Windows 8 was their first OS as per my knowledge with this motto. That was indeed my my first love for ecosystem. They had desktop, laptop, phone, phablet, tablet form factors and even a smart watch, which were all supported by this one OS. Eventually Xbox got added. I was literally a fan of that idea and that is when I became the fanboi for MSFT. Except for watch I used all form factors and it was really good to see and that was a great experience, also the syncing of data between all these devices was some kind of magic for me back then. They tried a lot with Windows 10 for this motto and they even added new Mixed Reality devices under the One OS, One Core umbrella.

Discontinuation of Windows Phone was the major reason though. But I didn\\u2019t get satisfied with that setup. After a few years I was searching for open-source apps and tried Google ecosystem which was in pre-matured state. I still had the feeling that none of them gave me the experience I wanted. I was a true hater of Apple back then. Because I didn\\u2019t feel that they were good enough or they didn\\u2019t have a set of features that I wanted. One day I was watching Apple Event where they revealed the upcoming features in their software lineup and all other APIs, SDKs. I must admit that I was pretty impressed. I was equally excited about their universal application just like when I got to know about Universal Windows Platform applications.
