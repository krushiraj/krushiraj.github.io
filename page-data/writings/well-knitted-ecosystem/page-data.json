I was literally a fan of that idea and that is when I became the fanboi for MSFT. Except for watch I used all form factors and it was really good to see and that was a great experience, also the syncing of data between all these devices was some kind of magic for me back then.

Discontinuation of Windows Phone was the major reason though. But I didn\\u2019t get satisfied with that setup. After a few years I was searching for open-source apps and tried Google ecosystem which was in pre-matured state. I still had the feeling that none of them gave me the experience I wanted.

After the class KC said that the guy\\u2019s name is Aravind Balla and he is currently switching to a remote job, also added that he is one of his favorites. That is when I had a hook to that moment and I started learning about what a remote job is and who is this guy that KC spoke about. Eventually, I ended up following Aravind on what he did to end up as a good Engineer working for a remote startup. Luckily fate was so good that I ended up being a colleague to him and a good friend cum mentor. I then came across this \", mdx(\"a\", {\n    parentName: \"p\",\n    \"href\": \"https://www.instagram.com/p/B3thXqCljSN/\"\n  }, \"https://www.instagram.com/p/B3thXqCljSN/\"), \" . After this, I started looking for people who can indirectly mentor me and then I found Raghava (full name Sai Raghava Acharya indeed an Acharya) who is a friend of Aravind, another mentor that I would never forget. Also, I found mentors in my childhood friends Sai Peddiwar, Murali, etc., I don\\u2019t deny the fact that the absence of these people would have affected my life in a very drastic way. I have learned a lot from each of them and I reciprocate them.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Finally, the most underrated teacher of my life is my mother who is responsible for my self-learning behavior which is a quality that I got from her, and my father who literally taught me the meaning of the famous dialogues \\u201DViluvale Aasthi\\u201D even before that dialogue was out.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"I couldn\\u2019t mention everyone but the above-mentioned are the ones who brought great changes in me to become a better person. On a final note, all I want to say is that there are a lot of people who influenced me and had an impact on me and that is the reason why I am here today and I am glad for that. I want to end this by saying that we can find a lot of people from which you can learn in enormous amounts, you just have to be curious and keen to find them, that\\u2019s it.\"));\n}\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3572198028","3765610985"]}
