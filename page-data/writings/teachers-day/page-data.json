If you\\u2019re interested in something then the fundamentals of that topic are well known to you and you enjoy exploring it, this is what I believe and he was the one who built the basics strong for my math and a reason for my special interest towards math and problem solving.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Next is definitely one of the youngest teachers who taught me Mr. \", mdx(\"strong\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"J. B. Ram\"), \". Probably he is just like an elder brother to me in age but he was the one who pushed me further more. He always said that if you don\\u2019t question about something you will never learn about it well and if you think you understood something then you must be in a place to answer anything about it. That was the point where I started to explore about things and questioning about stuff I don\\u2019t know. This quality is much needed for a person who wants to learn things by himself. I should say that he is definitely the first one to indirectly encourage me to go towards self learning which is much required for any person in my opinion. I should definitely share an incident that happened, I remember that one day we was teaching some concepts in Math and that concept was from third chapter (assume I don\\u2019t exactly remember) and I was actually trying to solve something that is from fourth chapter by sitting in the last bench. He saw me that I was writing something in the notes while he was teaching. He asked the person beside me about what I was doing, just to make sure I\\u2019m not doing anything that is not supposed to be done in that class. The fellow beside me had a glance and complained that I was solving problems that are not yet taught (in a tone that I was doing something wrong). Then Ram sir came to me to have a look at what I was doing, I was a bit frightened to what he would say. He had look at my notes and said, \\u201CGood, that is how a curious student should be. But never do this in class, do it in your free time or you can even come to me so we can do it together\\u201D. He also said to my fellow mate that there is nothing wrong in what I was doing and his tone of complaint is not necessary. That was the moment I learned that if you are curious enough then there will always be a person who will guide you.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"By the time I was in High School. I had to move back to my hometown and I was already missing both the previously mentioned teachers.

But I was lucky enough to find Mr. \", mdx(\"strong\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Satyajeet Rokad\"), \" who definitely was a great guide for me. He was more of an elder friend that a teacher to me. I was very glad that I could finally find someone who can resonate with me and guide me. Until I met him all my education was to gather information and put it out in the examinations to get good rank. But it all changed after I met him. There is a popular quote that says, \\u201CKnowing about something is not Knowledge it is just information. Information when understood and interconnected will become Knowledge\\u201D. He was the one who inculcated that thought in me. Instead of just gathering information he used to insist us to form knowledge base from that. In most of the schools in the area I lived they only valuate and give better graders for your answers to questions in exams if they are almost same to what is available in books. So it all feels like copy writing with a photographic memory. But Stayajeet was the one who used to discourage people who does that, he always use to encourage on answers for questions which are in own words of their understanding and logically correct no matter the length of answer. These all led me to become a good self learner.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"After High School and till graduation I didn\\u2019t find a teacher from whom I could learn something that changed my life drastically. Then \", mdx(\"a\", {\n    parentName: \"p\",\n    \"href\": \"http://missionrnd.com/\"\n  }, \"Mission RnD\"), \" happened, which I should say has changed my life in many ways.

If I had to write what I learned from each of them and what I learned from all the people from Mission RnD then it would become a mini series of blog posts. In short I would say that I got better at my skills and better at looking at a problem from a different perspective, though it is a math/coding/real life problem. KC always made us to think beyond what we could already do. He came with hard hitting realities that enlighten you. For example you can a couple of views for a problem say, bird\\u2019s eye view, straight forward view, blah blah blah but there comes a KC view :D from which you always seems to find the problem very easy and intersting to solve. He reinforce the self learning, conceptual learning, and many more other important things with his talks. And to talk about Peri Sir, his teachings are always peculiar (so are KC\\u2019s) they are fun and always has an inner meaning which is deeper when you listen to the same class again and again, that could be the reason why we and our seniors rush to his classes in the name of assisting him when he is teaching our juniors. There is definitely a lot to learn from him but I always feel like I wish I could attend more of his classes in person. Ethics, Values, Character, Discipline are something that I learned from him (though I\\u2019m not completely following discipline now, which I feel bad about). Recently one of my friends, Hari said, \\u201CDiscipline is something we lack in our day to day life or at least we should have a good discipline in our work life. That is what I learned from Peri sir and Americans during my masters\\u201D. I definitely agree on that, we are not completely badly disciplined but we are not at the level of what we wanted to be. I should really work on this.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Here comes my transition of learning from Mentors after Teachers. One day KC introduced a nerdy guy in our class who was supposed to teach us the basics of React.js.

That is when I had a hook to that moment and I started learning about what a remote job is and who is this guy that KC spoke about. Eventually I ended up following Aravind on what he did to end up as a good Engineer working for a remote startup. Luckily the fate was so good that I ended up being a colleague to him and a good friend cum mentor.

Everything was built as generic as possible to extend the capabilities and functionalities with ease. Auto complete suggestions feature was implemented based on the meta data that I had in an object.
